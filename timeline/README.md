# Project Timeline

## Phase 1
- Sketched initial hand concept
- Have one string that puls the finger. Then have a rubber band outside on the back of the finger that keeps hand open. So hand closes only if string is pulled

## Phase 2
- Built paper prototype
- Tested finger mobility

# Conclusions:
- 3 joints is too little mobility, need to have 4
- The round shape is too hard for now. Need to make the desine simpler to 3D model for now
- Wire goes outside, otherwice theres a chance the trajectory crumples
- Becouse we were not given in this asigment any other sensors or other ways to handle the motor than a speed paddle then need to come upp a way to make it recconaise when its pulled the max way closed
  - Could make it so that as long you press the speed paddle then it stays closed. Once you dont the springs open the hand
      - Could have i string that loops around the motor and goes upp the back off the finger but the mechanical side seems a bit complex for a 3 finger and 1 actuator system
  - Problably should add a max amount of rotations it can goe. Or just make shure the gear can only handle so much force and starts skidding when the max is reached
