# Robotic Hand (Class Project)
---
## Final Goal
The goal of this project is to design and build a 3D printed robotic hand controlled by a Raspberry Pi 5 and a motor.
For the class requirement, the system needs to demonstrate at least a basic gripping motion.
Whether the final version becomes a full hand or a simpler gripping mechanism depends on time, but the plan is to aim high and scale down only if needed.
(Project not finished yet, still in development.)

## Project Stages
1. Concept Phase
Started with sketches on paper. Tested joint movement using a paper model to understand flexibility and range of motion.
-> Chekout timeline

3. 3D Modeling
Next step is designing the fingers and palm in Solidworks. Focus is on improving joint movement and stability.

5. Motor Integration
After printing the 3D parts, the motor system will be connected and controlled using the Raspberry Pi 5.

4. Testing & Improvements
The hand will be tested for grip strength and movement control. Adjustments will be made if needed.
